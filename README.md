# Pong-SFML
A Pong game written in C++ with SFML. This is not all my original work as I built off of a tutorial. However, I added the opponent bat as well as a start and end screen and customized the game a little.

Make sure you have the SFML Library installed and run the .cp file "Pong"

If the font does not load then make sure to copy the entire pathname of the font file from your device and paste it in the program: font.loadFromFile("/Users/xxx/xxx/Nexa Light.otf");

That's all! Enjoy
